                <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white; font-size:125%"> One afternoon in 1880, Lucy Cross had a vision: a college in Central Florida. Five years later, Rollins became the first college in the area, and is now the oldest recognized college in the state.

Since that day over a hundred years ago when Cross transformed her vision into a reality, we have aspired to empower our students to see a vision of how the world could be and to provide them with the tools to effect the change they envision.

In 1880, Lucy Cross had a vision: a coeducational liberal arts college in Central Florida. In 1885, Rollins College was charted, and is now the oldest recognized college in the state. Since that day, Rollins College has aspired to empower its students to see a vision of how the world could be and to provide them with the tools to effect the change they envision.

Throughout history, Rollins has continued to demonstrate academic excellence within a liberal arts setting.
<br>
<br>

During World War I, the college established a naval unit that enabled students to take naval training classes. This led to the development of the current Rollins mascot – the Tar.

<br>
<br>
Continuing on the theme of advancing education, the college’s eighth president, Hamilton Holt, created the Rollins College Conference Plan. This plan emphasized close teacher-student scholarship and conversational-style class structure.

<br>
<br>
Also in 1927, the Animated Magazine speaker series was established. Annually, leading scholars, thought leaders, and artists engaged and shared ideas with the Rollins community. Today, the Winter Park Institute continues to bring in leaders of our time for Rollins College as well as the Winter Park Community.

<br>
<br>
In 1935, the Bach Festival Society choir and orchestra was founded; the third-oldest continually operating choir and orchestra in the United States. In 1935, in celebration of Bach’s 250th birthday, the Bach Festival Society was launched, which famously garners support from the Winter Park community.

<br>
<br>
In 1932, The Annie Russell theatre was dedicated, as well as the Knowles Memorial Chapel. Its first show starred Annie Russell herself.

<br>
<br>
In 1952, Rollins’ own radio station, WPRK, was launched. Like other forms of student media such as The Sandspur, WPRK has continued its success today.

<br>
<br>
At this time, Rollins began its mission in educating its students in terms of giving back to the community. In 1993, Rollins College dedicated the first Habitat for Humanity house sponsored by a Florida college.  In addition, the Office of Community Engagement was launched in 2001 as a way to connect in service with the community.

<br>
<br>
The Student-Faculty Collaborative Scholarship Program was launched in 1999 as a way for students and faculty to perform graduate-level research and further close ties between the student and the professor.

<br>
<br>
Since 2005, the U.S. News & World Report ranks Rollins #1 in the South and his been ranked highly since then.
